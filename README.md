Unfinished music-related slot machine game using Spotify's API

**Basic mechanics:**
1. Enter 3 artists' names and the app will return 3 related artists (generated at random) and each artists' most recent album
2. If you match the returned artists' names or the color of their albums, you win the game

**Still left to do:**
- Integrate API and algorithm for determining: 1) main color in an image, and 2) similarity between two colors
- Polish design
- Fix bugs
